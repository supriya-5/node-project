            "description":"The Moonlight Tour at Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the most popular tour programs in South Korea. A royal palace, which is an indispensable destination for Korean tourism, features distinctly different sentiments between day and night. Tourists flock to the palace during the day to experience a tranquil and relaxed atmosphere. When covered with a veil of darkness, the palace boasts of a different mood. The subtle lighting and mysterious acoustic effects add up different charms. As those attractive features are known through social networking services, royal palaces have recently emerged as new night attractions. Among royal palaces that open at night are the four major palaces in Seoul (Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeok Palace, Changgyeong Palace, and Deoksugung Palace) and Hwaseong Haenggung Palace in Suwon. Whether tour programs are available depends on each royal palace, but if it is, reservations must be made on the website. "

            "description":"At present, the United States is planning to invest US$150 billion for five years in the 10 sectors including autonomous driving, biotech, semiconductor and artificial intelligence. China is also increasing its R&D investment in the seven technologies including brain science and artificial intelligence and the eight sectors including smart manufacturing and new material development. Meanwhile, South Korea’s technological level and R&D investment in such sectors are much below those of high-tech industry leaders. In the quantum industry, South Korea’s level is 62.5 percent of that of the global leader whereas those of China and Japan are 93.2 percent and 90.4 percent, respectively. In 2019, South Korea’s R&D investment in the sector stood at 20 trillion won whereas those of the United States, the European Union, China and Japan were 224 trillion won, 124 trillion won, 77 trillion won and 39 trillion won, respectively. The South Korean government’s new goal is to raise those technological levels to at least 90 percent of the highest in the world by 2030. The rest of the 10 are semiconductor and display, cyber security, hydrogen technology, and secondary battery."
